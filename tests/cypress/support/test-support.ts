// just Vue reactivity), so this polls the focused slot and frame count -- exposed via #editor's
// data-slot-focus-id/data-slot-cursor attributes and .frame-div elements -- until they stop
// changing across consecutive checks.
//
// This drives its own fixed-interval setTimeout poll rather than Cypress's .should() retry --
// .should() re-runs its callback on Cypress's own internal retry cadence, which is NOT a fixed
// wall-clock interval: it slows down when the page is busy (e.g. re-rendering a large frame tree
// after pasting a big file), so "N consecutive stable reads" could need far more than N * (nominal
// interval) of real time and blow through the outer timeout despite the state genuinely having
// stabilised.

// fully fix this: unlike Playwright (which drives its poll from Node, outside the browser),
// Cypress's poll runs *inside* the same browser main thread that's doing the actual re-rendering,
// so even a "fixed" setTimeout(check, 30) can't reliably fire every 30ms under heavy DOM churn --
// confirmed via a real CI failure pasting a 92-frame file, where 8 consecutive checks (of a
// required 15) ate the entire 10s budget because each check iteration itself was taking far
// longer than 30ms. The fix: track how long the state has been unchanged by *wall-clock time*
