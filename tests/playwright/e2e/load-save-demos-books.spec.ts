    // modal's "shown" handler (fired once the dialog is already interactable), so a chapter
    // picked in the brief window before "shown" actually fired got silently wiped out -- e.g.

    // fix moved the reset to the dialog's "show" event (fired before it's interactable), closing
    // that window.
