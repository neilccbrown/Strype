// There's no dedicated test hook for "the graphics canvas just redrew" (turtle/strype.graphics
// drawing happens inside a running Python program with no JS-side signal of its own -- see

// incidental, unconditional DOM write on every actual redraw: it sets #pythonGraphicsCanvas's
// data-scale attribute (to the same value, if the scale hasn't changed) -- and a MutationObserver
// fires an "attributes" record on every setAttribute call regardless of whether the value
// changed. Confirmed empirically: drawing a 4-sided turtle square produced exactly 8 matching
// mutation records (2 per side) that then stopped, and a single mouse click that adds one Actor
// produced exactly 1 more. Call this once (after the graphics tab/canvas exists, before
// triggering any drawing) and then waitForGraphicsSettled() after each action that should cause
// a redraw, instead of guessing how long the animation/response will take.

// Waits for the graphics canvas to stop redrawing (see setupGraphicsRedrawObserver above),

// Requires the redraw count to stay unchanged for a short quiet window before concluding the
// drawing has settled, since a drawing sequence (e.g. a turtle animating across the screen) can
// span several redraws over time.
//
// That "stability" signal is right for a program that draws once and then stops (a turtle
// animation, a single matplotlib render), but is structurally wrong for a program whose Python
// code is an ongoing `while True: ... pace(N)` loop: such a loop keeps redrawing forever, so the
// count never truly stabilises and "3 consecutive unchanged reads" would never trigger --
// confirmed via a real, deterministic CI failure (not just flakiness) where this silently fell
// through to the full timeout every time for a loop-driven test. For that case there's a second,
// fallback condition: once several redraws have landed AND a bit of real time has passed since
// the first one, that's good evidence the most recent action (e.g. a keypress) has had multiple
// loop iterations' worth of opportunity to render, even though "stable" will never fire on its
// own. The fallback only engages once real redraws are actually happening (not from the outset),
// and single-draw callers almost always hit the faster "stable" path first regardless.
