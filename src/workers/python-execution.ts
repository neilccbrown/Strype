// Here is an explanation of the overall architecture involving Pyodide, our Strype libraries and so on:
//
// Pyodide runs in a web worker, which is like a separate thread.  This file, python-execution.ts is the web worker code.
// The functions are exposed near the bottom using Comlink.expose.  The main function is executePython.  The only
// communication methods between web workers and the main thread are message channels.  Comlink is a Google-originating
// library that allows it to look like you are calling a web worker method from the main thread in a fairly normal way,
// and Comlink routes the parameters via the message channels.  It also lets you pass callbacks so that the webworker
// can call back into the main thread and again this is done underneath via message channels.
//
// There are two key things to know about data and web workers in Javascript:
//
// 1. Any objects (things like OffscreenCanvas) can only live on one thread, so you can't share data directly.  This is
//    both good (removes any possibility of simultaneous modification) and bad (you have to think carefully about where
//    data lives and how to share any changes).
//
// 2. The communication between the threads using Comlink (especially in conjunction with other libraries we'll come to)
//    can only use "plain" data: numbers, booleans, strings, and combinations thereof (arrays, or objects containing
//    only plain data).
//
// The other things to know are around sync/async, Pyodide and communication:
//
// - All underlying messages are sent asynchronously (i.e. without waiting for reply).  This means that all function
//   calls from Comlink have a Promise<..> return value, and if you want to wait for a return you'd need to "await"
//   or use .then().
//
// - When Pyodide calls a Javascript function (e.g. for reading stdin, or getting an Actor's position or asking which
//   keys are pressed), it is done in a normal (NOT async) call.  So you have a problem that you can't talk to the main
//   thread via messages/Comlink to get a message because you can't await the Promise-d answer.  It also means that
//   Pyodide code cannot do anything that needs async functions (e.g. certain image drawing operations).
//
// - As a work-around you can use a service worker (a different thing than a web worker, intended to be long lived).
//   So we have a service worker, which is just there to route messages around.  So you should never need to modify it.
//   This is all wrapped up into packages sync-message (which relay messages via the service worker) and comsync (which
//   combines sync-message with Comlink).
//
// - This synchronous messaging via the service worker is *expensive* in terms of time.  Firefox seems a bit slower than
//   Chrome, and on Firefox it can take 1-2 milliseconds per call.  If you are trying to run at say 30 frames per second,
//   you only have around 33 milliseconds per animation frame, so even 10 such calls can take up most of your time.
//
// So, we have two main constraints when designing our architecture: we need to message between the web worker and main
// thread using only plain data, and we need to try to minimise the amount of synchronous calls.  We need:
//  - the Pyodide thread to run the Python code (which will make Actors, move them around etc), and
//  - the main thread to draw the canvas (it's possible Pyodide could using an OffscreenCanvas, but if the main thread
//    does it then it can be done at any time regardless of what Pyodide is doing, and takes CPU cycles off the Pyodide
//    thread, which will be the busier thread while running Python flat out), and to listen for key events and mouse
//    clicks.  Plus, the main thread has to be responsible for any async code that Pyodide thread is not allowed to run.
//
// The solution is in the file worker_bridge_type.ts which has a protocol (with explanatory comment) for communicating
// between the threads.  There are "Sync" messages which need a reply, but where possible we use "Async messages" that
// can be fired off without needing a reply, as this is faster.
//
// There are several concepts that are split up:
//  - Actors are Python-only objects in Pyodide.  No Javascript function ever directly interacts with an Actor.
//  - Sprites are things with a position, rotation, image etc.  They are effectively the Javascript version of an Actor
//    but the mapping is not one-to-one.  Notably: the background is a Sprite but has no Actor, and say() bubbles on
//    actors are Sprites but also have no Actor.  Sprites are referred to from Python via an integer handle that maps
//    to an array/Map held in Javascript.  So only integers are passed between Python and Javascript to refer to sprites,
//    never the actual Sprite (or Actor) objects.
//  - Each Sprite's image can either be an ImageBitmap or OffscreenCanvas.  We generally prefer ImageBitmap if the image
//    is not modified because it uses less resources.  But if the user edits the image (via Image class in Strype) then
//    it needs to become OffscreenCanvas.  So we must allow for either possibility at most points.
//
// In terms of splitting up the data and so on:
// - The web worker is primarily responsible for tracking Actor state (via Actors in Python) and sprite state (via
//   SpriteManager in Javascript).  It mirrors the SpriteManager state to the main thread via a dedicated async message
//   channel.
// - All the actual images and canvases are held on the main thread for fast communication-free rendering there.  All
//   manipulations of the image requested by Python code must be sent to the main thread.  Manipulations are usually
//   "Async" (see above) so fast, but queries (mainly: what colour is this pixel) are "Sync" meaning they need a reply
//   and are slow.

// Tell Typescript we are on a web worker, so we can access web worker bits but not the DOM:
