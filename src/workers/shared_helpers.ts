// Unlike serviceWorkerReadyAndInControl() above (which only checks that *some* controller is
// present), this actually round-trips through the sync-message channel to confirm the service
// worker is currently intercepting requests for it. A controller can be present yet not truly
// answering (e.g. Safari silently losing a backgrounded tab's service worker), in which case a
// Pyodide run that depends on the channel (input(), cloud file I/O, output catch-up) would only
// discover the problem ~5s in, via a ServiceWorkerError from deep inside the worker. Kept to a
// short timeout so a genuinely dead channel is detected fast rather than stalling the Run click.
// Also callable from inside a dedicated Worker (see reportControllerStatus() in
// python-execution.ts) -- `document` and `navigator.serviceWorker` aren't necessarily defined
// there (Chromium doesn't expose navigator.serviceWorker to Workers at all: crbug.com/40364838),
// so both are guarded rather than assumed:

        // *isn't* intercepting, a GET to an unmatched path is commonly rewritten to a 200 (e.g.
        // an SPA's own index.html fallback, in dev and in many production static hosts) -- so a
        // GET here could report "healthy" when the channel is actually dead. POST to the same
        // unmatched path correctly falls through to a real 404 instead:

// from inside a dedicated Worker (see isServiceWorkerChannelResponsive()'s own comment on that),

// must be guarded here the same way isServiceWorkerChannelResponsive() already guards it above,
// or this throws a ReferenceError inside the worker the moment a controllerchange event fires
// there (confirmed via a real CI failure on macOS/WebKit: tests/playwright/e2e/sound-wait-after-run.spec.ts,
