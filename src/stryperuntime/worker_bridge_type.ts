/*
 The architecture in Strype for execution is as follows.  There are two "threads": the main thread and the Pyodide web worker thread.
 The communication from the main thread to Pyodide is generally very limited: it starts execution, and may interrupt it.
 The communication is almost entirely from the Pyodide worker to the main thread.
 
 There are two main ways to communicate from Pyodide to main thread:
   - Synchronous communication (Pyodide web worker sends request, then waits for an answer, blocking Pyodide execution)
   - Asynchronous communication (Pyodide web worker sends request, but doesn't wait for an answer because one isn't needed).

 The particular issue in our situation is that Sync communication sends its reply via a service worker (which is a hack, but because it's
 the only way to block on waiting for a message in non-async code) and is very slow.  It can take 1-2 milliseconds, which is
 a lot if you want performance (you can only do maybe 20 such calls per animation frame if you are aiming for 30 frames per second).
 So ideally we want to use Async communication whenever we can.   
 
 Thankfully, most calls can be done Async.  If you want to draw a line on a canvas, you don't need a response or for it to happen immediately,
 as long as the requests remain ordered.  So if you say "draw line, draw circle", it can happen later just so long as the circle
 is drawn after the line.  The only calls that strictly need to be Sync are those which send a meaningful reply.  Two obvious cases
 are loading sounds and loading images.  So they are Sync.
 
 A potentially troublesome pair of commands are reading pixel values or reading sound values.  They need a reply, but if 
 we do it one request at a time (users will usually do many such reads in a loop) it's potentially very slow.  So it's
 actually quicker that we do one Sync call to cache the entire set of values, rather than one Sync call per individual
 value.  If the user sets an individual value we can update the cache and send an Async update to the main thread.  The
 only awkward case is if the user does a complex operation (e.g. a draw circle) which means we will need to discard cache.
 But it seems rarer that they will do a lot of "draw a shape, read a pixel" in alternation.
 
 There is a similar case for checking if keys are pressed.  We cache the full set of pressed keys for a limited time, then
 discard the cache and fetch it again. 

 So: below there are protocols for Sync messages (and their return value) and Async messages.  Note that we keep
 sprite updates (which use a dedicated channel) separate from other graphics/sound APIs to keep organisation neater.
 
 The Sync and Async channels can only support a limited number of primitive types to be sent, so we enforce that using
 a bit of Typescript magic (the Expect<IsSerializable<...>> lines).
