// CLAUDE.md's "no runtime server contact for JS/wasm libraries" principle just as fully as the
// public/js/-vendored assets (tree-sitter, Pyodide) do; the difference is only that a pure-JS
// library like this one can be inlined into the build rather than needing to be fetched as a
// separate binary asset at runtime.
